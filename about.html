<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Yash Kumar Sharma, a 21-year-old Computer Engineering student from Khurja, Uttar Pradesh, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Engineering (COE) at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology.</p>
<p>I began my programming journey with C and C++ during my first two years of college, which helped me build a strong foundation in logic and problem-solving. Currently, I’m expanding my skillset by learning Web Development and Python through hands-on courses on Udemy. While I haven’t completed any formal projects or internships yet, I’m actively working on personal development with the goal of building a strong portfolio that will help me secure valuable industry experience.</p>
<p>My short-term goal is to complete my current courses and land an internship where I can apply my growing skills to real-world challenges. In the long term, I aim to become a proficient developer and contribute meaningfully to the tech community—whether in a startup, an established company, or my own venture someday.</p>
<p>Outside of academics, I enjoy listening to music and watching anime, which keep me relaxed and inspired. I’m comfortable working independently, enjoy taking leadership when needed, and also thrive in team environments.</p>
<p>I’m in the process of building my GitHub, LinkedIn, and a personal portfolio website to showcase my progress and future projects.</p>
